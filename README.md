!!!Make sure your version of Chrome driver (lastest version included in the folder) matches your Chrome browser (find link here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)!!!

Run the script and put in your UW Net login information (UW-Net ID doesn't include @wisc.edu)

Then you will have 15 seconds to verify the login on DUO
